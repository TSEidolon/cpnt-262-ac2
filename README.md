 - Arrays were a bit confusing so I had to review it at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target = "_blank">MDN Web Docs - Array, 2022</a>:
    - The .pop (remove the last item) and .push (adds item to the end) commands were interesting and useful as a quick way to remove and add items into the end of the array.
      - .shift and .unshift if you want to add/remove items in the beginning of the array.
